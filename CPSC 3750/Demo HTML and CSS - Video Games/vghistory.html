            <p>Video games have come a long way since their inception in the 1950s and 1960s. The earliest games, like <i>Tennis for Two</i> (1958) and <i>Spacewar!</i> (1962), were experimental and often played on large, room-sized computers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1950:</strong> Claude Shannon wrote about programming a computer to play chess, laying the groundwork for games on computers.</li>
                <li><strong>1952:</strong> <i>OXO</i> (or <i>Noughts and Crosses</i>) was created by Alexander S. Douglas as part of his PhD dissertation, one of the first graphical games.</li>
                <li><strong>1958:</strong> <i>Tennis for Two</i>, created by William Higinbotham, was one of the first games to use a graphical display on an oscilloscope.</li>
                <li><strong>1961:</strong> MIT students, including Steve Russell, developed <i>Spacewar!</i>, a combat game that introduced interactive gameplay and multiplayer combat.</li>
                <li><strong>1966:</strong> Ralph Baer began work on "The Brown Box," the prototype for the first home video game console.</li>
                <li><strong>1967:</strong> The first light gun game was created, a precursor to later shooting games.</li>
                <li><strong>1971:</strong> <i>Computer Space</i>, inspired by <i>Spacewar!</i>, became the first commercially sold video game.</li>
            </ul>
